# capstone-project

My project is live at https://nicg-capstone.herokuapp.com/

There is no front-end since that is not a requirement for the project.

There is the url: https://nicg-capstone.herokuapp.com/login which allows someone to use the login feature of OAUTH, BUT it does not save the bearer token into the file.

Routes inclue: 

/actors - GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE

/movies - GET, POST, DELETE

Two POSTMAN Tests are included in the file. One for Actor View - and one for Managers who should be able to complete all actions.
